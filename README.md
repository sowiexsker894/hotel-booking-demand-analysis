## üîç Case Study Analysis

### üìö Data Origin
- **üë• Authors**: Antonio Nuno de Almeida, Ana Nunes, and Luis
- **üìÖ Publication Date**: January 2, 2019
- **üîó Source**: ScienceDirect
- **üèõÔ∏è Institution**: University Institute of Lisbon, Portugal

### ‚úÖ Data Credibility
The data originates from queries made to the hotels' Property Management System (PMS), stored in SQL format from previous administrative records, ensuring reliability.

### üéØ Applicable Use Cases

| Stakeholder | Application |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Hotel Chains** | Portfolio optimization, customer satisfaction improvement, market expansion |
| **Independent Hotels** | Niche opportunities, service differentiation |
| **Academic Researchers** | Consumer behavior studies in tourism and hotel management |
| **Tourism Organizations** | Understanding tourist flow and policy development |

### üíº Business Problems Addressed

- **Improve hotel profitability** through dynamic pricing strategies and promotions during low seasons
- **Enhance customer experience** with personalized services for returning customers  
- **Optimize revenue fluctuation** with appropriate marketing strategies for low-activity periods

### üí° Key Insights

> **Cancellation Patterns**: High or low cancellation rates could indicate business problems. Potential factors include climate changes, high vacation seasons, overly flexible cancellation policies.

> **Dynamic Pricing Strategy**: Hotels should implement pricing strategies considering both seasonality and room type, offering discounts or special packages during high seasons for less visited rooms.

> **Seasonality Analysis**: Seasonality relates to both room types and seasons, allowing for price increases during high-demand periods.

> **Customer Loyalty**: Due to the existence of new and repeat customers, special services could be created for returning guests - premium access to hotel events, coupons, or visit credits.

### ‚ùì Key Analysis Questions

- How many bookings are made by hotel type?
- Is demand increasing over time?
- What are the high and low demand seasons?
- How many bookings include children and/or babies?
- Is parking space availability important?
- In which months are most booking cancellations made?

#### Missing Data Treatment
```R
# Create helper dataset "dataset_clean"
dataset_clean <- na.omit(hotel_data)
# Remove columns with more than 50% NA values
dataset_clean <- hotel_data[, colMeans(is.na(hotel_data)) < 0.5]
View(dataset_clean)
```

#### Outlier Identification
```R
# Create boxplot to visualize outliers
boxplot(dataset_clean$adr, main = "Box Plot - ADR")

# Identify outliers using Interquartile Range (IQR)
Q1 <- quantile(dataset_clean$adr, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
Q3 <- quantile(dataset_clean$adr, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

# Define limits
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
outliers <- dataset_clean$adr[dataset_clean$adr < lower_bound | dataset_clean$adr > upper_bound]
```

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| **IQR** | 56.7 |
| **Lower Bound** | -15.8 |
| **Upper Bound** | 211 |
| **Q1** | 69.3 |
| **Q3** | 126 |
| **Outliers Count** | 3,793 |

#### Outlier Treatment
```R
# Winsorization to limit outliers
install.packages("DescTools")
library(DescTools)

# Calculate 5th and 95th percentiles
lower_bound <- quantile(dataset_clean$adr, 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
upper_bound <- quantile(dataset_clean$adr, 0.95, na.rm = TRUE)

# Manual winsorization by replacing values outside limits
dataset_clean$adr[dataset_clean$adr < lower_bound] <- lower_bound
dataset_clean$adr[dataset_clean$adr > upper_bound] <- upper_bound

# Re-run BoxPlot
boxplot(dataset_clean$adr, main = "Box Plot - ADR (After Winsorization)")
```

### Data Visualization

#### Question 1: Bookings by Hotel Type
```R
hotel_count <- hotel_data %>%
  group_by(hotel) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

ggplot(hotel_count, aes(x = hotel, y = count, fill = hotel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Number of Bookings by Hotel Type", x = "Hotel Type", y = "Number of Bookings") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Question 2: Demand Over Time
```R
# Convert month name to number if necessary
hotel_data$arrival_date_month <- match(hotel_data$arrival_date_month, month.name)

# Create 'year_month' column combining year and month
hotel_data$year_month <- make_date(hotel_data$arrival_date_year, hotel_data$arrival_date_month, 1)

# Verify year_month column creation
head(hotel_data$year_month)

# Group by year_month and count bookings
demand_over_time <- hotel_data %>%
  group_by(year_month) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

# Visualization: line chart of demand over time
ggplot(demand_over_time, aes(x = year_month, y = count)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Booking Demand Over Time", x = "Date", y = "Number of Bookings") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Question 3: Seasonal Patterns
```R
seasonality <- hotel_data %>%
  group_by(arrival_date_month) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(match(arrival_date_month, month.name))

ggplot(seasonality, aes(x = factor(arrival_date_month, levels = month.name), y = count, fill = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Booking Seasonality", x = "Month", y = "Number of Bookings") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Question 4: Lowest Demand Period
```R
lowest_demand_month <- seasonality[which.min(seasonality$count), ]
lowest_demand_month
```

#### Question 5: Bookings with Children/Babies
```R
children_bookings <- hotel_data %>%
  filter(children > 0 | babies > 0)

nrow(children_bookings)

ggplot(children_bookings, aes(x = factor(children > 0, levels = c(TRUE, FALSE)), fill = babies > 0)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Bookings with Children and/or Babies", x = "Children Present", y = "Number of Bookings") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Question 6: Parking Space Importance
```R
parking_spaces <- hotel_data %>%
  group_by(required_car_parking_spaces) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

ggplot(parking_spaces, aes(x = required_car_parking_spaces, y = count, fill = required_car_parking_spaces)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Importance of Parking Spaces", x = "Number of Parking Spaces", y = "Number of Bookings") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Question 7: Monthly Cancellations
```R
hotel_data$arrival_date_month <- match(hotel_data$arrival_date_month, month.name)

hotel_data$year_month <- make_date(hotel_data$arrival_date_year, hotel_data$arrival_date_month, 1)

cancellations <- hotel_data %>%
  filter(is_canceled == 1) %>%
  group_by(year_month) %>%
  summarise(cancel_count = n())

ggplot(cancellations, aes(x = year_month, y = cancel_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "red") +
  labs(title = "Monthly Cancellations", x = "Month", y = "Number of Cancellations") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## üìä Conclusions {#conclusions}

> ### Hotel Type Analysis
> Based on booking data by hotel type, we can conclude that **city hotels** tend to be more popular than resorts. This could be due to various factors such as central location, business travel convenience, and urban amenities.

> ### Demand Trends
> When analyzing booking demand over time, we observe a **consistent increase** in bookings for both hotel types, especially during vacation months and special events.

> ### Seasonal Patterns
> **High seasons** coincide with vacation months (June, July, and August) and major festive events, where higher booking volumes are observed. This pattern provides valuable insights for revenue management strategies.

---

## üí° Recommendations {#recommendations}

### Dynamic Pricing Strategy
Implement **dynamic rates adjusted to seasonality, demand, and room type**. During low seasons, offering specific promotions and discounts could incentivize bookings, while premium pricing during high seasons can maximize revenue.

### Cancellation Policy Review
Review cancellation policies, especially in months where higher cancellation rates are detected. Consider implementing **more restrictive policies** during peak periods while maintaining flexibility during low-demand periods.

### Customer Loyalty Programs
Create **loyalty programs** to reward returning customers, providing exclusive benefits such as discounts, room upgrades, event access, or personalized services. This can significantly improve customer retention and lifetime value.

### Continuous Service Improvement
Implement a **continuous improvement strategy** in customer service based on analysis of special requests. This will help personalize each guest's experience, improving satisfaction and retention rates.

### Data-Driven Decision Making
Establish regular **monitoring and analysis cycles** of booking patterns to quickly adapt to market changes and optimize operational strategies.
